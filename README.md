# Kepler-s-Law
Create your own solar system and to create an animation of the Moon-Earth-Sun system.
Kepler's Laws state the orbits of the planets around the Sun have the form of an ellipse, a line from the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times and the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. The model combines Newton's second law and the gravitational force and amounts to two coupled differential equations. These differential equations are second-order as they involve the acceleration of the planet relative to the Sun. Using data of the planets, it is relatively easy to create the orbits of the planets around the Sun and to demonstrate that these orbits are indeed ellipses. The solutions of these coupled differential equations allow for verifying Kepler's third law
